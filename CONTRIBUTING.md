## Contributing to the driver

### Bugfixes

- Follow the general coding style of the rest of the project:
  - 2 space tabs
  - no trailing whitespace
  - comma last
  - inline documentation for new methods, class members, etc
  - 0 space between conditionals/functions, and their parenthesis and curly braces
    - `if(..) {`
    - `for(..) {`
    - `while(..) {`
    - `function(err) {`
- Write tests and make sure they pass (execute `npm test` from the cmd line to run the test suite).
